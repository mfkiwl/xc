# Actions
To build a structure that meets the criteria of resistance, serviceability and economy, the structural engineer must carefully evaluate all the actions that will eventually affect the structure.

The modules in this folder are intended to help with the definition of loads, load cases and combinations.

Subdirectories contains utils and data related to loads taken from
different standards. Those taken from Spanish codes are not translated
into English.
