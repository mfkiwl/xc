# Open source finite element analysis program.

## Purpose
The purpose of XC is simple: **master the analysis software instead of being mastered by the analysis software**.

## Overview
You can see some screenshots <a href="https://github.com/xcfem/xc/tree/master/doc/screenshots" target="_new">here</a>.

The objective is to develop a robust structural analysis tool, which is owned by the community, and allows the users to improve and adapt it for their own needs. Open-source software (or, even better, free software) is the natural evolution of the tools structural engineers have been using forever.


It's all about developing tools that allow us to keep going forward (much in the sense of <a href="https://youtu.be/QhGUtJFl0HM" target="_new">designing for strength, economy and beauty</a>) instead of repeating the same old solutions but in a faster way.

## Features
The main capabilities of the program:

- Geometry modeling and mesh generation tools.
- OD, 1D, 2D and 3D elements.
- Linear and non-linear analysis, static and dynamic.
- Fiber section models (modelization of RC members,...).
- Activation an deactivation of elements (construction phases,...).
- Tools for implementing structural codes (in progress):
    - Reinforced concrete structures: Eurocode 2, ACI 318, EHE, SIA 262
	- Steel structures: Eurocode 3, AISC 360, EAE, SIA 263
	- Wood structures and masonry structures (in progress...).
- Interface with Industry Foundation Classes through <a href="http://ifcquery.com/" target="_new"> IFC++</a> (in progress...).
- Interface with SCIA Engineering (in progress...).
- Component-based finite element method (CBFEM) for analysis and design of steel conections (in progress...).

## Installation
See <a href="https://github.com/xcfem/xc/blob/master/install/install.md" target="_new">install</a>.

### Docker Installation
The easiest way to use XC is to run it through a Docker container. The container mounts a local folder on your host computer, so you can still source control your files without the need to include any XC source code or its dependencies. You can find the Docker installation instructions [here](./install/docker_install.md).


### For Previous version of Docker
You can also find <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/antonsurv/xcfem" target="_new">Docker images</a> created by Anton Surviyanto. The source code of the Dockerfile is <a href="https://github.com/antonsurv/docker-antonsurv-xcfem" target="_new">here</a>.

### Dependencies
Don't worry, if you have a decent *nix system the installation is straightforward. You can take a look to the list of dependencies [here](https://github.com/xcfem/xc/blob/master/install/dependencies_list.md).


## Where to start
The programs lacks of a user manual (would you help us with that?). Anyway you can start with some simple examples you'll find <a href= "https://github.com/xcfem/xc_examples" target="_new"> here</a>. You can also take a look [here](https://github.com/xcfem/xc/blob/master/doc/how_to_start.md)

## Links
You can take a look to the project <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/xcfemanalysis/" target="_new">home</a>, to the <a href="https://xcfem.github.io/XCmanual/" target="_new">Python documentation</a> or the <a href="https://codedocs.xyz/xcfem/xc/index.html" target="_new">C++ API documentation</a> or to our <a href="http://www.xcengineering.xyz/html_files/software.html" target="_new"> XC page in the company site.</a> (all of them are work in progress ;-).
